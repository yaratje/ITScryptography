# ITScryptography
This repository contains code for reproducing and analyzing cryptographic properties, specifically equivocation and key uncertaintyâ€”for the Caesar Cipher and Simple Substitution Cipher as described and discussed by Shannon in "Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems" (1949). 

## Project Files

- **`caesar_cipher.py`**  
  Calculates and normalizes n-gram probabilities for possible Caesar cipher decryptions.

- **`ngram_prob.py`**  
  Generates n-gram probabilities from English text corpora.

- **`decrypt.py`**  
  Provides utility functions to generate all possible Caesar cipher shifts for a given ciphertext.

- **`equivocation_from_caesar.py`**  
  Calculates the equivocation (remaining uncertainty about the key) as more letters of the caesar ciphertext are revealed.

- **`equivocation_from_caesar_loop.py`**  
  Runs multiple trials using random English word-based messages and calculates the average equivocation as more ciphertext is observed.

- **`equivocation_simple_substitution.py`**  
  Simulates equivocation for a Simple Substitution Cipher by generating random keys and scoring decrypted text using n-gram statistics.

## Run the experiments:
    All the experiments can be run via the command line. Parameters are located as variables in the experiment files.

    For example, to run the repeated Caesar cipher equivocation simulation:

    ```bash
    python equivocation_from_caesar_loop.py
    ```

    This script will generate and save plots inside the `plots/` folder.
